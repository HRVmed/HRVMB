                <p>Inpatient DRG review and chart auditing is a crucial part of any healthcare facility. It is required to ensure that your charts are accurate and in compliance with the complex and often fluctuating rules and regulations of the billing and coding world. Chart auditing is necessary for hospitals to ensure maximum return on reimbursables.</p>
<br>
                <p>Proper documentation is the source of your revenue. Proper documentation of services and accurately using the codes will ensure your claims are not being denied. It is also a way that physicians can check their performance and determine areas that need improvement. Another reason to perform an audit is to identify reimbursement deficiencies. There are many benefits for having regular chart audits for your facility. This service will help keep you up to date on the codes for procedures and to show the effectiveness of the care provided. These audits will keep you running smoothly and increase your revenue stream.</p>
<br>
                <p>Insurance companies do not make it easy to get reimbursed for the valuable services your facility provides to your community. Patient care and providing the best healthcare services should be your only priority when it comes to your healthcare facility. The business aspect of this not only deters your focus from your patients, but also is a source of stress. You heal. Leave the revenue cycle management to Right Medical Billing.</p>
