                <p>The essential phase in medical billing and coding is insurance eligibility verification. Eligibility and insurance verification are critical to receiving accurate and timely information about insurance coverage and reimbursement. A healthcare organization may be losing money; if necessary, checks and balances are not in place.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Failure to validate eligibility and obtain prior authorization can result in delayed payments and denials, resulting in lower collections and revenues. Delaying reimbursements has a direct influence on the company’s cash flow.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Benefits of a Simplified Eligibility Verification Process</h3>
                
                <p>Patient insurance eligibility verification is the first and perhaps most critical step in the medical billing process. That means your service provider has to be on the ball to obtain and accurately record all eligibility information. Physicians need to verify each patient’s eligibility and benefits to ensure they will receive payment for services rendered.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The verification of patients eligibility for health insurance is essential since it affects the companies cash flow directly. Some of the advantages of outsourcing eligibility services are stated here:</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size:1.5em;"><b>Improves Cash Flow</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>When claims have access to up-to-date eligibility data, they have a better chance of being approved and processed fast. That helps the firm maintain a consistent cash flow by decreasing denials and write-offs and increasing patient satisfaction.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size:1.5em;"><b>Smooth Workflow</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Eligibility responses are viewed coherently, and that enhances overall process efficiency. The result will improve patient experience and fewer negatives following a consistent and streamlined approach.</p>
                <br>      
                <p style="font-size:1.5em;"><b>Boost Self-Pay Revenue</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>Health service providers can receive additional funds by electronically linking self-paid consumers with managed managed Medicaid databases. That also helps locate, categorize, and file claims for unwittingly covered patients, which release self-paying patients from financial costs.</p>
                <br>
